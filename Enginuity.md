# 🌐 Enginuity (Work-in-Progress)

Enginuity is a **raw, rough idea of a student-focused website**.  
It was created using **HTML and CSS** with the help of **AI tools**.  
⚠️ Please note: **Not everything is working yet** – this is an **early draft** and mainly a **concept/demo project**.

## 📌 Features (Planned / Drafted)

- 🎨 **Static Website** – Built only with HTML and CSS.  
- 🏠 **Main Page** (`Main page.html`) – Central hub for navigation.  
- 👥 **Community Page** – Placeholder for student collaboration.  
- 📚 **Resources Page** – Concept for sharing study materials.  
- 📅 **Schedule Pages** – Draft layouts for timetables/events.  
- 🛠 **Support Room Page** – Idea for student–teacher support.

## 🚀 Live Demo (Preview Only)

Once GitHub Pages is enabled, the preview will be available at:  
👉 **[Enginuity Website](https://anushkat-03.github.io/Enginuity/)**  

*(Currently, this is a draft project – so the pages may not look or function properly yet)*

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project is **not a final product** – it is a **rough idea** to experiment with:
- Using **AI** to generate website layouts.  
- Understanding basic **HTML & CSS** for a multi-page site.  
- Hosting simple static sites with **GitHub Pages**.  

---

## ✨ Future Goals

- Rename `Main page.html` → `index.html` for GitHub Pages support.  
- Add **JavaScript** for real interactivity.  
- Improve **responsiveness** (mobile/tablet support).  
- Replace placeholders with **working features**.  
- Consider using **modern frameworks** like React or Tailwind CSS.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

- **AI Tools** – for helping generate the initial code structure.  
- **GitHub Pages** – for free static hosting.  
- Inspired by the idea of a **student resource & community hub**.
